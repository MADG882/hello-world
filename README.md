Simple app to swap cheramics with
I have tried to learn programming, first VBA, VB and JAVA with Android studio. IÂ´ve found it beeing a far to slow method for achieving anything at all - so I hope for collaboration with others will do the trick.
An app where people can svap cheramics with each other, you either sell or buy others palates and cups of the same origin, type and colors.
So the app will take photos and the users submit textinformation about their goods and when anyone see something he/she have in the cupboards - maybe an interchange can take place.
The idea is simple as that.
